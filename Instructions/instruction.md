## README 1: Project Scope and Initial Setup

### **Project Overview**
You are tasked with building a state-of-the-art Small Language Model (SLM) for Telugu and Hindi. The model should be efficient, culturally relevant, and outperform existing SLMs in these languages. Your work will involve data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and benchmarking.

### **Objectives**
- Develop a robust SLM for Telugu and Hindi, focusing on high-quality, culturally relevant text generation and understanding.
- Ensure the model is efficient and can be trained and deployed on limited hardware resources.
- Benchmark against leading Indic SLMs and LLMs.

### **Key References**
- **Paramanu Models**: Efficient Indic SLMs with advanced tokenization and instruction tuning[6][7].
- **Chandamama Kathalu Project**: Large-scale, culturally rich Telugu dataset and SLM methodology[5].
- **TinyStories Paper**: Demonstrates the feasibility of small, coherent language models for story generation[5].
- **NVIDIA Hindi SLM**: Example of enterprise-grade Hindi SLM development[1].
- **Machine Translation Project**: Practical workflow for Hindi-Telugu NLP tasks[4].

### **Initial Steps**
1. Review the above resources for inspiration and methodology.
2. Set up your environment:
   - Python 3.8+
   - PyTorch or TensorFlow
   - Hugging Face Transformers
   - Tokenizers (custom Indic tokenizer recommended)
   - GPUs (NVIDIA RTX 3070+ or A100 recommended, but CPU inference should be possible)

### **Next Steps**
Proceed to README 2 for detailed instructions on data collection, preprocessing, and model architecture selection.

## README 2: Data Preparation and Model Development

### **Data Collection**
- **Telugu**: Use the Chandamama Kathalu dataset (40,000+ pages of manually proofread stories)[5]. Supplement with other open-source Telugu corpora if available.
- **Hindi**: Use datasets referenced by Paramanu and NVIDIA Hindi SLM projects[1][6][7]. Include news, literature, and conversational data for diversity.
- **Parallel Data**: For translation or bilingual tasks, consider the Samanantar dataset for Hindi-Telugu sentence pairs[4].

### **Data Preprocessing**
- Clean and normalize text (remove HTML, special characters, and personal information).
- Tokenize using an Indic-specific tokenizer, such as mBharat from Paramanu, which supports both scripts and Romanized text[6][7].
- Align sentences for parallel corpora if translation tasks are included.

### **Model Architecture**
- Start with a transformer-based architecture (encoder-decoder, decoder-only, or Seq2Seq with attention)[4][5].
- For efficiency, follow the parameter scaling used in Paramanu (e.g., 13Mâ€“367M parameters)[6][7].
- Implement RoPE embedding scaling for longer context windows on limited hardware[6].
- Consider language-specific tokenization and instruction tuning for best results[6][7].

### **Training**
- Pretrain on monolingual and bilingual corpora.
- Fine-tune with instruction datasets (e.g., 23k instructions per language as in Paramanu)[6][7].
- Use transfer learning if leveraging existing models.

- [Paramanu: Efficient Indic Language Models][6][7]
- [Chandamama Kathalu: Telugu SLM][5]
- [TinyStories: Small Model Methodology][5]
- [Machine Translation: Hindi-Telugu NLP][4]

### **Next Steps**
After training, proceed to README 3 for evaluation, benchmarking, and deployment guidance.

## README 3: Evaluation, Benchmarking, and Deployment

### **Evaluation**
- **Automatic Metrics**: Use BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity for quantitative assessment[4].
- **Human Evaluation**: Rate outputs for grammar, coherence, creativity, and factuality as done in Paramanu[6][7].
- **Vernacular Coverage**: Ensure the model captures informal and dialectal variations, referencing best practices from vernacular SLMs[8].

### **Benchmarking**
- Compare your SLM against:
  - Paramanu Hindi and Telugu models[6][7]
  - Chandamama Kathalu Telugu SLM[5]
  - NVIDIA Hindi SLM[1]
- Use standard benchmarks like IndicEval, and consider open-ended generation and comprehension tasks.

### **Deployment**
- Export the trained model for inference (CPU or GPU).
- Provide an API (RESTful, Flask, or Django) for real-time usage[4].
- Optionally, build a user interface for interactive testing.

### **Continuous Improvement**
- Collect user feedback for further fine-tuning.
- Explore adding other Indic languages or expanding domain coverage.

First build a UI which will take the text and a button to summarize that will make an internal api call and generates the summary. start with a simple version first and then go deep.
